Unlike closed environments defined by experts or programming constraints, the open world is characterized by the implicit and explicit unknown. The overarching question driving our endeavors is whether **AI can conquer the open world**.

Supported by the [Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)](https://www.darpa.mil/program/science-of-artificial-intelligence-and-learning-for-open-world-novelty), our initiative focuses on designing different novelties and novelty generators for Monopoly.
