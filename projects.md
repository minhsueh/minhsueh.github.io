<p style='text-align: justify;'> Embarking on the frontier of artificial intelligence, our project delves into the formidable realm of the open world, a significant challenge for current AI systems. Unlike closed environments defined by experts or programming constraints, the open world is characterized by the implicit and explicit unknown. The overarching question driving our endeavors is <strong>whether AI can conquer the open world</strong>?
<br>
&emsp;Supported by the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/science-of-artificial-intelligence-and-learning-for-open-world-novelty">Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)</a>, our initiative focuses on designing different novelties and novelty generators for Monopoly.
<br>
&emsp;<strong>As a human, can you detect the novelty in the above animation?</strong> </p>
