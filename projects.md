<p style='text-align: justify;'> Embarking on the forefront of artificial intelligence, our project delves into the formidable realm of the open worldâ€”a significant challenge for current AI systems. Unlike closed environments defined by expert definitions and programming constraints, the open world is characterized by implicit and explicit unknowns, presenting an immediate challenge that could potentially overwhelm AI systems. The overarching question driving our endeavors is <strong>whether AI can conquer the open world</strong>?
<br>
&emsp;This project was supported by the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/science-of-artificial-intelligence-and-learning-for-open-world-novelty">Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)</a>, aiming to develop an AI system capable of detecting and adapting to novel situations swiftly. My primary contribution involves the design of an automatic novelty generator intended for the creation of impactful novelties. This architectural framework exhibits adaptability to various dynamic programming languages.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> As AI advances, the limitations imposed by closed-world environments hinder its practical application in the dynamic reality of the open world. I have developed a Poker simulator utilizing <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html">Gymnasium</a>, a standardized API for reinforcement learning to bring attention to the challenges posed by open-world scenarios within the broader AI community. Leveraging the widespread interest in poker and the adoption of a standardized API, this initiative aims to garner wide acceptance within the AI community for addressing the complexities of open-world challenges. </p>
