title: Blockchain and Bitcoin
---
This is a highly simplified explanation of *Bitcoin* and *blockchain*. I hope it can provide a general understanding of digital currency. The analogy is illustrated in Figure 1. Each cryptocurrency transaction is recorded in a *block*, paralleling logging transactions in a monthly ledger. Moreover, when multiple *blocks* are interconnected, they form a *blockchain*, akin to aggregating monthly ledgers into a year ledger.

But you might have a question: where is *Bitcoin*? You can think of *Bitcoin* as a transaction record. As depicted in Figure 2, each colored box signifies a distinct amount of *Bitcoin*. For instance, TX1 represents ₿10, TX2 is ₿1, and so forth. Each spent *Bitcoin* can be traced back to its preceding *Bitcoin* transaction.

You can envision, with all transactions documented on the *blockchain*, there's no necessity for a central authority (such as a bank) to authenticate every transaction! This is referred to as **decentralization**.

As mentioned earlier, this is an exceedingly simplified explanation. For a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanism, here are some valuable resources:
