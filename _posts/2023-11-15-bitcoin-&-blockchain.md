title: Blockchain and Bitcoin
---
<p style='text-align: justify;'> This is a highly simplified explanation of <em>Bitcoin</em> and <em>blockchain</em>. I hope it can provide a general understanding of digital currency. The analogy is illustrated in Figure 1. Each cryptocurrency transaction is recorded in a <em>block</em>, paralleling logging transactions in a monthly ledger. Moreover, when multiple <em>blocks</em> are interconnected, they form a <em>blockchain</em>, akin to aggregating monthly ledgers into a year ledger.

&emsp;But you might have a question: where is <em>Bitcoin</em>? You can think of <em>Bitcoin</em> as a transaction record. As depicted in Figure 2, each colored box signifies a distinct amount of <em>Bitcoin</em>. For instance, TX1 represents ₿10, TX2 is ₿1, and so forth. Each spent <em>Bitcoin</em> can be traced back to its preceding <em>Bitcoin</em> transaction.

&emsp;You can envision, with all transactions documented on the <em>blockchain</em>, there's no necessity for a central authority (such as a bank) to authenticate every transaction! This is referred to as <strong>decentralization</strong>>.
